Hollow Shaft “Turret” is a 3D printed, motorized mechanism for tracking in 2 or 3 axis. The hollow shaft refers to the mechanical design of rotation, such that it takes into account cable management. For instance, lets have a camera mounted on single axis that is connected to PC via cable. If the camera rotates 360 degrees around its axis the cable wounds around the mechanism providing the rotation. The more the camera rotates, the more cable is wound around the mechanism.


This repo includes the firmware & software to control the turret using Arduino MEGA.
